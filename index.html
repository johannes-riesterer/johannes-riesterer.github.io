          <h1>Welcome to the Büro Zwei research laboratory</h1>
          <p>In order to continously improve my skills and to stay up to date i code small programs which are presented here.
          </p>
        <p> At the moment you can only watch videos of these programs  but the programs itselves and the source code will be available soon.
        </p>
        <p> Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Discrete geometry</h2>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/93247178?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="536" height="302" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
The main task of discrete geometry is to transfer concepts of differential geometry, where everything is  assumed to be differentiable,  to the world of computer graphics, where everything is highly non differentiable. Many modern and fast algorithms make use of these concepts. Here you can see the discrete version of gaussian curvature. For more details see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature" title="curvature">Wikipedia</a>.

 <h2>Realtime simulation</h2>

<p>
Physical simulation of rigid bodies has a long history in computer science. There are a lot of different approaches and it has many applications in the fields of robotics, virtual reality and in the entertainment industry.

<h2>Finite element analysis</h2>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/93239393?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="536" height="302" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
The finite element method is a technique to approximate the solution of a  partial differential equations on a computer. Partial differential equations are  used to describe 
processes appearing in physics,  engineering,  economics or biology.

<h2>A journey through the Hopf fibration</h2>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/87388395?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="536" height="336" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
Basically the Hopf fibration is a continuous map from the three dimensional sphere to the two dimensional sphere. The two dimensional sphere lives in three dimensions and looks like the surface  of a football while the three dimensional sphere is hard to imaging since it lives in four dimensions. The map was discovered by the mathematician Heinz Hopf. He proved that this map is significantly different from the trivial map which maps everything to a single point. Moreover he demonstrated with the help of this map that the three dimensional sphere locally looks like  the union of twisted circles which is called the Hopf fibration.  The video is a visualization of this fibration and thus  of the three dimensional sphere.

<h2>Different shaders applied to Tori</h2>

Shaders are small programs which run directly on the graphic card (gpu).
