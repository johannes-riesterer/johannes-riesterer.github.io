<h2>Discrete geometry</h2>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/93247178?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="536" height="302" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
The main task of discrete geometry is to transfer concepts of differential geometry, where everything is  assumed to be differentiable,  to the world of computer graphics, where everything is highly non differentiable. Many modern and fast algorithms make use of these concepts. Here you can see the discrete version of gaussian curvature. For more details see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature" title="curvature">Wikipedia</a>.

 <h2>Realtime simulation</h2>
 <p>
Physical simulation of rigid bodies has a long history in computer science. There are a lot of different approaches and it has many applications in the fields of robotics, virtual reality and in the entertainment industry.
</p>
 <h3>Position based methods</h3>
 <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/103111569?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="536" height="302" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
 <p>
 This is a so called position based approach to simulate softbodies. From the mathematical point of view the results are quite inaccurate
 but the visible result still looks plausible.

 <h3>Impulse based methods</h3>

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/92245499?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="536" height="302" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2>Finite element analysis</h2>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/93239393?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="536" height="302" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
The finite element method is a technique to approximate the solution of a  partial differential equations on a computer. Partial differential equations are  used to describe 
processes appearing in physics,  engineering,  economics or biology. Here you can see how two waves behave in a square-shaped area.

<h2>A journey through the Hopf fibration</h2>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/87388395?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="536" height="336" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
Basically the Hopf fibration is a continuous map from the three dimensional sphere to the two dimensional sphere. The two dimensional sphere lives in three dimensions and looks like the surface  of a football while the three dimensional sphere is hard to imaging since it lives in four dimensions. The map was discovered by the mathematician Heinz Hopf. He proved that this map is significantly different from the trivial map which maps everything to a single point. Moreover he demonstrated with the help of this map that the three dimensional sphere locally looks like  the union of twisted circles which is called the Hopf fibration.  The video is a visualization of this fibration and thus  of the three dimensional sphere.

<h2>Different shaders applied to Tori</h2>

<p>
Shaders are small programs which run directly on the graphic card (gpu).

<h2>Fun with the Raspberry Pi</h2>

<h2>Realtime raytracing on the GPU</h2>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/87389051?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="536" height="336" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
Raytracing is a technique to generate photorealistic images and it is also often used for medical imaging. A detailed description can be found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)" title="wikipedia">wikipedia</a>. However it requires considerable processing power. On the other hand it can be parallelized very easily. Since today's graphic cards and in particular their graphics processing units (gpu's) are designed in a highly parallel manner, it is possible to generate realtime animations with this technique. The main problem here is to compute the intersection between  rays and the objects of the scene. Instead of exactly calculating these intersections, one can  approximate them by an algorithm called raymarching with distancebounds. In many cases this  is faster but it also may produce artefacts.
